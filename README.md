# Cooking
A desktop application for food amateurs that allows you to order food based on recipes from the Cooking communauty. This application is coded in C# and WPF, the server is SQL based as I used mySQL.

# Demonstration
As the app was an academic project there needed to be a 'demo mode' in order to show that we were able to make some SQL requests and display some key data
